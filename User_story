bike            docked
DockingStation  check_bikes

As a member of the public,
So that I am not confused and charged unnecessarily,
I'd like docking stations not to release bikes when there are none available.

DockingStation  not_release

As a maintainer of the system,
So that I can control the distribution of bikes,
I'd like docking stations not to accept more bikes than their capacity.

DockingStation  refuse_bike

As a system maintainer,
So that I can plan the distribution of bikes,
I want a docking station to have a default capacity of 20 bikes.

DockingStation refuse_bikes(if bikes > 20)

As a system maintainer,
So that busy areas can be served more effectively,
I want to be able to specify a larger capacity when necessary.
